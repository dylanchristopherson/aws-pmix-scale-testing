Requirements:
	mysql client - For loading data from database
	fzf - For easy and interactive selection of runs to graph
	    (https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
	gnuplot w/ pdf support - Creates graphs of selected runs

Use:
	Run graph.sh
	use interactive search to find graph to run by date/hash/branch
	choose graphs to create by graph number
	       for multiple type each number with space as the separator
	Results are stored in a subdirectory named the runnumber

Output:
	(All in ./<runnum>/)
	"<graphname>" is the name of the graphs selected when running graph.sh
	
	<graphname>.pdf - pdf graph generated by gnu plot
	<graphname>.raw - data extracted from database from sql query

Creating New Graphs:
	 To create a new type of graph, create <graphname>.inf and <graphname>.sql
	 The .sql file will contain the mysql query to be run to get all data from the database.
	 The .inf file will contain the graph type data such as the name, description, and graph title
	     This file can be copied from info.template
	     The variables referenced in the graph title are the variables of graph.sh,
	     however in this case they are all just values out of the database

	     The needed variables are as follows:
	     "name" - the name of the graph when asking the user
	     "desc" - a very brief description of what is shown in the graph
	     "title" - the title to be shown above the graph

Possible improvements:
	 graph.sh can use fzf more effectively
	 	  Use fzf to choose which graphs to run
		  Use fzf's ability to select multiple items to graph several runs at once
